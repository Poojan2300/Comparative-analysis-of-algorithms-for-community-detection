# Community Detection Research

This repository contains the Python code, datasets, and results for the research paper titled **"Comparative Analysis of Community Detection Algorithms."** It focuses on applying and comparing algorithms like Louvain, Leiden and Label Propagation on social and water distribution networks.

## Overview

This project evaluates the performance of various community detection algorithms based on metrics like modularity, clustering coefficient, and runtime. Results include visualizations of detected communities and detailed performance comparisons.
